var trickHistory: SortedPile = Array.init(repeating: Array.init(repeating: Int(), count: 6), count: 12)

// each Pile here will have the Player Index of the leading player, the four cardIDs in order of play, and the playerID of the winning card
// index 0 is the first turn, and index 11 is the last turn
// trickHistory[i][5] == trickHistory[i+1][0] (winner leads next trick)

// take a tableau and own player number, plus index of player who led
// check for highest card played (which player index)
// can you beat it? if no, play a pointer if possible, or follow suit as low as possible or play a low-ranked off-suit
// if yes, is the trick being led by your partner? if yes, don't beat it if possible
// if no, beat it

// helper method: find highest card in hand in suit
// OR: order cards in hand according to suit; maybe split into arrays for each suit, ordered high to low
